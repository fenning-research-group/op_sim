Optical Simulation of Metal Halide Perovskite Photovoltaics

## Motivation

This repo is dedicated to the pipeline design and operation of FDTD (Lumerical) and SETFOS (TMM+RT) softwares, along with other tried methods to simulate/model the performance of metal halide perovskites (MHP) and MHP-Silicon 2T tandems. 

### Demo of FDTD Results
